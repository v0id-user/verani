 Contributing to Verani

First off — thank you for taking the time to contribute 🤍
Verani is built in the open, and we welcome improvements, bug reports, and new ideas.

## How You Can Contribute

- **Report Bugs**: open an issue with clear steps to reproduce.
- **Suggest Features**: open an issue describing what you’d like to see.
- **Improve Documentation**: PRs for README, docs, or comments are always appreciated.
- **Submit Code**: fixes, enhancements, or examples are welcome.

## Development Workflow

1. **Fork** the repository and clone it locally.
2. Create a new branch for your change:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

3. Make your changes.
4. Commit with a clear message and push your branch.
5. Open a **Pull Request** targeting the `master` branch.

- Describe your change and reference any related issues.

## Coding Guidelines

- Use **TypeScript** for all new code.
- Make sure everything is properly formatted and typed.
- Keep commits small and focused.
- Follow existing code style (we use strict linting/formatting).
- Write tests when possible.

## Using AI Tools

We welcome contributions assisted by AI tools (ChatGPT, Copilot, Cursor, etc.), but with strict expectations:

- **You are responsible for the output.** Do not blindly copy/paste AI-generated code.
- All code must compile, pass linting, and run tests before submission.
- Review and refactor AI-assisted code to match the **Verani style** (clarity, type safety, and minimal complexity).
- PR descriptions must explain the intent in your own words, not an AI dump.
- If you use AI to generate significant portions of a contribution, please mention it in your PR so reviewers can give it extra scrutiny.

In short: AI can help, but you must stay the human in the loop.

## Questions or Support

If you’re unsure about anything, open an issue and we’ll help guide you.
